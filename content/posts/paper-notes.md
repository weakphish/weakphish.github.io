I've found that taking paper notes is something that is just as much about the enjoyment of the act as it is about the outcome (recall, being good at my job, etc).

For example, each day I make a new page in my notebook with some checkboxes for tasks to do, and then take notes as they pop up.

Pushing my mouse aside and taking out my pen switches my brain into a mode that seems trained for thinking, whereas just alt-tabbing to
a new window doesn't create the same conditions.

As well as that, the _feeling_ of writing on paper itches some deep part of my monkey brain descended from 10th century monks copying
books by hand, perhaps. It's just unmatched.

Anyway, the point is, I _could_ find information quicker and with more detail if I stored them in Obsidian - but if I don't
really enjoy the practice, what's the point?
