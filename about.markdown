Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John!
I'm a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems in Raleigh, North Carolina.
I work in Cisco's CollabAI BU doing... well, collaborative AI :) specializing in back-end distributed systems written
primarily in Python and Java.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- Playing Ice Hockey (something I started in late 2023)
- Weight training
- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99373945-jack-allison) 
- [Video games](https://www.ign.com/playlist/weakfish6)
- [Movies](https://letterboxd.com/john123allison/)
- ... and a variety of other random things that pop into my brain. 


In the 2021-2022 academic year, prior to graduating, I was serving as President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group. 
This group got me my start in technology, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to lead.

In Summer 2021, I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton developing router security packages! I 
learned a lot about networking, C++, and Python.

Areas of interest in technology include software and distributed systems, static analysis, and reverse engineering.
