Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John!
I'm a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems in Raleigh, North Carolina.
I work in Cisco's CollabAI organization doing... well, collaborative AI :) specializing in back-end distributed systems written
primarily in Python and Java.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- Playing Ice Hockey
- Hobbyist video game development (using primarily the Godot engine)
- Weight training
- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99373945-jack-allison) 
- [Video games](https://www.ign.com/playlist/weakfish6)
- [Movies](https://letterboxd.com/john123allison/)
- ... and a variety of other random things that pop into my brain. 

Prior to graduating from NC State:

- In the 2021-2022 academic year, I served as President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group. 
    - This group got me my start in technology, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to lead.

- In Summer 2021, I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton developing router security packages! I learned a lot about networking, C++, and Python.

Areas of interest in technology include software and distributed systems, static analysis, and reverse engineering.
