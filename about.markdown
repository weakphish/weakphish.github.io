Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John!
I'm a student at NC State University studying Political Science and Computer Science. I'm graduating this May, 2022, and headed to Cisco as a Site Relability Engineer.

In my free time, I like to play video games, play basketball, play guitar, and a variety of other random things that pop into my brain. One of these days I'd like to write an essay on rotating hobbies, but who knows. I tend to get intersted in one thing or a few things at a time for a few months and then switch again - hence, the first sentence of this paragraph will likely change every now and then :-). I used to view this as a curse, but now I am grateful for the breadth of experiences it has afforded me.

I'm currently serving as the President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group. This group got me my start in technology, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to lead.

This past Summer (2021), I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton developing router security packages! I learned a lot about networking, C++, and Python.

Areas of interest include software and systems, static analysis, and reverse engineering.
