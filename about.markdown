Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John!
I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at Cisco Systems in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- Weight lifting
- Playing league soccer
- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99373945-jack-allison) 
- [Video games](https://www.ign.com/playlist/weakfish6)
- [Movies](https://letterboxd.com/john123allison/)
- ... and a variety of other random things that pop into my brain. 

One of these days, I'd like to write an essay on rotating hobbies, but who knows. I tend to get interested in one thing 
or a few things at a time for a few months and then switch again - hence, the first sentence of this paragraph will likely change every 
now and then :-). I used to view this as a curse, but now I am grateful for the breadth of experiences it has afforded me.

In the 2021-2022 academic year, prior to graduating, I was serving as President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group. 
This group got me my start in technology, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to lead.

In Summer 2021, I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton developing router security packages! I 
learned a lot about networking, C++, and Python.

Areas of interest in technology include software and systems, static analysis, and reverse engineering.
