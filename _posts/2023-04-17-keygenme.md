# keygenme-trial
This challenge is from PicoCTF 2021. It's labelled "Reverse Engineering," but I'd regard it as more PWN since traditional RE involves binaries.

## Running the program
Running the provided program, `keygenme-trial.py` , shows us a simple terminal interface for a... magic program? We can see part of it is "locked" behind a "paywall," which is likely our target. Let's inspect the code!

## Code inspection
At the very top of the python file, we can see a few globals:

```python
# GLOBALS --v
arcane_loop_trial = True
jump_into_full = False
full_version_code = ""

username_trial = "MORTON"
bUsername_trial = b"MORTON"

key_part_static1_trial = "picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_"
key_part_dynamic1_trial = "xxxxxxxx"
key_part_static2_trial = "}"
key_full_template_trial = key_part_static1_trial + key_part_dynamic1_trial + key_part_static2_trial
```

See anything interesting? It looks like they define the flag format and thene allow part of it to be dynamic, then concatenate it all together.

Looking further down, we find a function called `check_key(key, username_trial)` 

Inspecting this, we see that it checks it against the length of the `key_full_template_trial` and returns false if it is not the right size. After that is where it gets interesting. 

It appears to check the first little bit of the user provided key against the static parts of the key template, i.e. `picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_` and then does a... manual for loop? On the rest. 

For each character in the user provided portion of the key, it checks it against the `sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[x]` where `x` is an integer value. Here's the full code below:

```python
# Check dynamic part --v
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[4]:
    return False
else:
    i += 1
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[5]:
    return False
else:
    i += 1
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[3]:
    return False
else:
    i += 1
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[6]:
    return False
else:
    i += 1
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[2]:
    return False
else:
    i += 1
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[7]:
    return False
 else:
    i += 1
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[1]:
    return False
else:
    i += 1
if key[i] != hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[8]:
   return False
```

## Solving

Now, remember, `username_trial` is defined as MORTON. So, what we need to do is take the `sha256("MORTON").hexdigest()` and create a key where the corresponding indices are in the given order (4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 8)

In this directory you will find my solve script.

Hope this helped!
