Hey all. It's been awhile since I wrote something. Over the past few weeks, 
as I've gotten more into The Gym (tm), I've also gotten more and more frustrated 
with the availability of iOS applications to track exercise goals / progress / etc. including building programs and plate calculations. 
Because of this, I decided I'd take a stab at writing my own that suits my exact preferences. 
After all, what is a hacker if not a weirdo who just says "screw it, I'll do it myself?"

At the moment, my proposed 'feature-set' is primarily three items:
1. Buildable custom fitness programs
  - Done through 'cards' that are dragged and dropped onto a weekly calendar
  - Pick an exercise, weights (percentage OR specific) and sets/reps
  - Plate calculations with choices of what you have available to you
2. Track your progress for each exercise 
3. Check-in with progress pictures, notes, etc.

The next step is to do some kind of UI mock-up. If anyone reading this has any ideas or 
requests, hit my email - jack@weakphi.sh
